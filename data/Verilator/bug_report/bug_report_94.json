    "Summary": "Split _eval when it grows large",
    "Description": "Is there any reason we should not make _eval obey --output-split? It is one of the long pole functions in terms of compilation speed on large designs with a lot of sub blocks + if it we do #2367 it has a danger of growing even bigger. Peformancewise I don't think this should hurt much as we can just tail-call the next piece of _eval at the end of the previous, so if the split is not too small this should not be very noticeable."
