    "Summary": "Nonexistent id linked to an existing symbol",
    "Description": "References to nonexistent foo::pkg::bar (foo is an empty package) Verilate without errors if a package pkg with a variable static int bar exists.\nIf foo::pkg::bar does exist, it has priority over pkg::bar, as expected.\nHere is an example in test_regress format.\nTested with the latest commit (5fce23e) on Fedora, Linux 6.0.14."
