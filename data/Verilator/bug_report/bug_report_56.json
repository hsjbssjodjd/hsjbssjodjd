    "Summary": "Removing LifePost optimization yields t_if_deep failure",
    "Description": "The VarVertexType::PRE vertex carries an ordering constraint that is only an optimization, and ignoring it should still yield correct behaviour. Disabling this constraint in V3Order (by removing the edges to/from the VarVertexType::PRE vertices) however makes the t_if_deep test fail."
