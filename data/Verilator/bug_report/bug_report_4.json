    "Summary": "Recursive display causes segmentation fault after commit e24197f",
    "Description": "What 'verilator --version' are you using?  Did you try it with the git master version?\n\nSegmentation fault on $fwrite function on commit e24197f, no issue on commit 63db60f. The issue still exist on git master version.\n\nWhat OS and distribution are you using?\n\nWSL2 Ubuntu 23.10 + gcc v11 & v12\nMacOS clang v14.0.3\nThe problem can be replicated with both envs. MacOS always stops at segmentation fault. In Ubuntu, running multiple times, segmentation fault occurs about 70% of the time and passes 30% of the time.\n\nHow to replicate\n\nI can't reproduce this issue with a simple test case. Attached verilate_e24197f.tar.bz is a complex test case. Use \"make failed\" to run the failed case, and use \"make pass\" to run the passed case.\nSearch the source tree for the keyword \"FAILED_CASE\" to see the differences to test. An error occurred on the $fwrite function."
