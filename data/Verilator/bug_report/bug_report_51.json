    "Summary": "void'(some_queue.pop_front()); in the body of an if-stmt lints cleanly but fails to produce good cpp",
    "Description": "Seems related to a closed issue:\n#1641\nI will attempt to fix this myself, and I have to create a test_regress for it, but the gist is:\nalways @(posedge clk) begin : some_queue_handler_fails\n  if (some_queue.size()) begin\n    void'(some_queue.pop_front());\n  end\nend\n\nalways @(posedge clk) begin : other_queue_handler_good\n  if (other_queue.size()) begin\n    other_queue = other_queue[1:$]; // pop front explicitly\n  end\nend\n\nThe 'some_queue' case is giving me a verilator error like:\nVblahblah__DepSet_h311ab79c__0.cpp:99:53: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token\n             vlSelf->__PVT__some_queue.pop_front()}\n                                                     ^\n                                                     ;\nmake[1]: *** [/foo/verilated.mk:257: Vblah__ALL.o] Error 1\n\n\nWhat 'verilator --version' are you using?  Did you try it with the git master version?\n\nVerilator 4.219 devel rev v4.218-44-gb5791192\n\nWhat OS and distribution are you using?\n\nDebian, seems unrelated to OS though\n\nMay we assist you in trying to fix this in Verilator yourself?\n\nI will try to track it down, seeing as explicit queue manipulation works."
