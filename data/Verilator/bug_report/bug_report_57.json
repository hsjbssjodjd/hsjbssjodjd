    "Summary": "UNUSED is mistakenly reported on signal connected to inout port of two submodules",
    "Description": "The attached example (inout_connect_inlined.tar.gz) has a Sender and Receiver submodule each with an inout port, through which the sender writes a value and the receiver reads it.  These are instantiated in a parent module that wires them together:\nwire [31 : 0] recv$IN;\nReceiver recv(.CLK(CLK), .IN(recv$IN));\nSender #(.outvalue(32'd3737)) send(.OUT(recv$IN));\n\nWithout -Wall, Verilator compiles and runs the example (transmitting the value 3737 from sender to receiver):\n      3737\n      3737\n\nWith warnings turned on, Verilator reports that the connecting wire is unused:\n%Warning-UNUSED: mod.v:11:17: Signal is not used: 'recv$IN'\n                            : ... In instance mod\n   11 |   wire [31 : 0] recv$IN;\n      |                 ^~~~~~~\n                 ... For warning description see https://verilator.org/warn/UNUSED?v=4.215\n                 ... Use \"/* verilator lint_off UNUSED */\" and lint_on around source to disable this message.\n\nThis happens with a recent HEAD and an earlier release:\nVerilator 4.215 devel rev v4.214-50-ga14394db\nVerilator 4.200 2021-03-12 rev v4.110-43-g5022e81af (mod)"
