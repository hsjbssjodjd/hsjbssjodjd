    "Description": "@RRozak #4533 a3c154d has caused a regression in several ivtests (run under sv-test framework)\nhttps://github.com/steveicarus/ivtest/blob/master/ivltests/sv_class13.v\nhttps://github.com/steveicarus/ivtest/blob/master/ivltests/sv_class14.v\nhttps://github.com/steveicarus/ivtest/blob/master/ivltests/sv_class17.v\nhttps://github.com/steveicarus/ivtest/blob/master/ivltests/sv_class18.v\nThese now core dump on destruction.  Could you take a look please?   Also please convert at least one of the tests above into a test_regress form to catch these in the future.  Thanks!"
