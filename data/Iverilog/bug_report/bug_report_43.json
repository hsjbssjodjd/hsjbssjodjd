    "Summary": "assertion fails with struct inside struct",
    "Description": "Hi,\nI  am trying to use some verilog code that uses system verilog structs inside structs. I have boiled my code down to bare minimum, but I still cannot get it to compile in iverilog. The code compiles and runs in ModelSim. I have tried the newest master branch on github of iverilog.\nIn the attached file I have commented out the four failing lines. By removing the comments you can see these errors when compiling the module:\ntest.v:18: assert: elab_lval.cc:1169: failed assertion name_idx->name == member_name\ntest.v:19: assert: elab_lval.cc:1169: failed assertion name_idx->name == member_name\ntest.v:21: error: Unable to bind wire/reg/memory main.sub.sub_local' in test'\ntest.v:22: error: Unable to bind wire/reg/memory main.sub_list['sd0].sub_local' in test'\nTo compile the test, I have been using this command line\niverilog -g2012 test.v\nThe file test.v is found here:\ntest.v.txt\nI hope you can help.\nBest regards,\nKai Kristian"
