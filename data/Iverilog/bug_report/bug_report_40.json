    "Summary": "Expression evaluates to 1'bx instead of expected 1'b0",
    "Description": "The following code outputs and assigns y to 1'bx instead of 1'b0. This happens in iverilog version 10.3 and also happens in version 10.0 (11/23/14) on edaplayground. However, this seems to execute fine in version 9.6 and 9.7 on edaplayground.\nI have a link to the design loaded in edaplayground.\nmodule testbench;\n   wire y;\n   reg  clk;\n   reg [15:0] wire0; // Reducing the size of wire0 to 15 bits seems to fix the output.\n   reg        reg1 = 1'h0;\n   assign y = reg1;\n   initial\n     begin\n        clk = 1'h0;\n        wire0 = 1'h0;\n        #10 $finish;\n     end\n   always #5 clk = ~clk;\n   always @(posedge clk) $strobe(\"%b\", y);\n   // Problematic line, should assign 1'b0 but assigns 1'bx.\n   always @(posedge clk) reg1 <= (wire0 >> {wire0 ~^ 1'b1, wire0});\nendmodule\nAfter running\niverilog testbench.v -o im && ./im\n\nthe output is x instead of 0.\nIf the always block is not used, and the expression is assigned to y directly, the result is the expected 1'b0. Any changes to the expression seems to fix the result as well."
